# Hangman Game Ver 1.2
# Ethan Frailey
# 10/13/20
# The classic game of Hangman.  The computer picks a random word
# and the player wrong to guess it, one letter at a time.  If the player
# can't guess the word in time, the little stick figure gets hanged.

#Version 1.2 bring new words + definitions to those words
